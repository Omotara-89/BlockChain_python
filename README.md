# BlockChain_python

The objective of this repository is to design a wallet that can send either testnet bitcoin or testnet ethereum crytpocurrencies to any counterpart address that meet the requirementes of the network.

In addition to that, the wallet has provisions to execute transactions with real bitcoin.

The wallet is comprised of 4 sections:

  Section 1: Installation of the right dependencies for the activity
  
  Section 2: Address derive, which includes generating 3 set of addresses for two Crypto currency Networks: Bitcoin-testnet (BTCTEST) and Ethereum (ETH).
  
  Section 3: Transactions execution along the testnet bitcoin network (btc-test).
  
  Section 4: Transaction executions along the local Ethereum Network (oyinnet)
  
 # Section 1- Installation and Project setup
 
  •	Clone the hd-wallet-derive tool into the wallet folder and install it
  
  •	Open up Git-Bash as an administrator and perform the following steps, test that you can run the ./derive script properly and the output will be as shown in the image below
